Before going into the details of each variables, here is a brief description of the experiement: 
	The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 


The final_data has 88 columns and 180 observations. 
The first column is 'subject', which ranges from 1 to 30. The experiments was carried out with a group of 30 voulnteers and each subject represents one volunteer. 
The second column is 'activity', which includes WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING and LAYING. 
Other columns represent the mean and standard deviation of each activity performed by each subject.
